# SenchaTestDemo
Example workspaces to demonstrate use of Sencha Test

Both workspaces need a copy of the Ext JS 6.0.1 framework. The content of the "ext" folder
from any Sencha Cmd generated app can be copied into these sub-folders to complete their
setup.

Once the "ext" folder is placed in the folder, that folder cna be opened in Sencha Studio
by selecting "Open Workspace".
